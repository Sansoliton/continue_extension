1. Set the input power supply to the desired input voltage level for the test, starting from 2V and increasing by 1V up to 20V.
2. Connect the load resistor to the LDO's output to simulate the typical load conditions of 0.05mA.
3. Turn on the power supply at initial Zero Voltage and allow it to stabilize for 2 seconds.
4. Measure and record the output voltage of the LDO after stabilization at each input voltage level.
5. Calculate the Line Regulation for each input voltage level using the formula:
   Line Regulation (%) = [(Vout2 - Vout1) / Vout1] / [(Vin2 - Vin1) / Vin1] * 100
   where:
   - Vout1: previous output voltage
   - Vout2: Output voltage after changing the input voltage
   - Vin1: previous input voltage
   - Vin2: Input voltage after changing the input voltage
6. Repeat steps 1-5 for input voltage values ranging from 2V to 20V at 1V intervals.
